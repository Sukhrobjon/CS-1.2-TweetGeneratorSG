Questions:
1. What are the key features of the application? Are these clearly separated 
into their own files, classes, and/or modules?
2. Are the names of files, modules, functions, and variables appropriate and 
accurate? Would a new programmer be able to understand the names without too 
much contextual knowledge?
3. What are the scopes of variables and are they appropriate for their use 
case? If there are global variables, why are they needed?
4. Are the functions small and clearly specified, with as few side effects 
as possible?
5. Are there functions that could be better organized in an Object-Oriented 
Programming style by defining them as methods of a class?
6. Can files be used as both modules and as scripts?
7. Do modules all depend on each other or can they be used independently?

Answers:
1. Key features:
    reading the files
    creating histogram
    generating the sentence out of random words according to weight of the words
   Yes they are separated 
2. Some of the functions are not clearly picked. I am optimizing the code one 
by one everytime I see the issue


class Notes:
print was a just a key word in python2 
unlikely in python 3 it is a function

7/3 is float
7//3 is intiger division operator
